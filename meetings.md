Lower amounts of energy showers more interesting in the scientific detection

Run Model Model in between R1 and CTLearn Trigger
< 5k Params should be good for ASICs 

ASIC chip 22nm

## TODO 
Execution time metrics
FLOPS per inference
Make Leonid data work
investigate Cycling learning rates
