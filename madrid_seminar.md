# June 3 14:00 - IACT Data analysis

IACT :
Excellent angular resolution 5°
~15%uptime

Surface 
Moderate angular resolution 10°
Continuous uptime

satellite 1 ton per m2 sent in space

Use the atmosphere as a colorimeter ?
augments up to 5/6 order magnitude bigger area of detection

Shower fluctuations at lower energies ?


7000 events/s
Low gamma ray events
Good background suppression

# June 4 - Hands on CTLearn 

Data types :

R0 raw sensor data -> (CTA-PIPE)
R1 calibrated sensor data -> (CTA-PIPE) 
DL1 Cleaned up data -> (CTLearn)

# June 5 - Hands on part 2

AI Triggers meetings ?
Slack -> ask to join

# Discussion topics

- Multiple telescopes types in one single CTLearn model
- Resuming the training vs restarting from scratch ? 
- Suggestions :
    - Pre-trained weights rename to monoscopic model weights
    - Better view of expected inputs/outputs of models X

# To look at :
- PBDL
